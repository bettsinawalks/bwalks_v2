    <h4>My Journey</h4>
    <p>Hi üëãüèΩ! I am a designer and I like building things. I also like drawing, making music and playing video games.</p><br>

    <p>Most days you‚Äôll find me <span style="text-decoration:line-through">working from a coffee shop, drinking an oat flat white</span>, hanging with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bailey.bear.pomsky/">pomsky dog Bailey</a> and scrambling for free time.</p>

      <h4>How It All Began</h4>

      <p>When I was a kid, I saw Toy Story 1 for the first time, I wanted to become a character animator. However, growing up like every other millennial, in a time where technology changed from analog to digital and instant connectivity became part of our everyday lives, I became very interested in the design world and anything related to the information age.</p><br>

      <p>I still have a keen eye for animation and I always try to use it as a tool to engage with users, for interface design, storytelling and marketing. In fact, 100% of my freelance projects are in animation.</p><br>

      <p>After finishing my Bachelors in visual and media arts, I spent my time creating installation art and experimenting with visual programming using Processing and MaxMSP. Later on, I wanted to explore the less existential world of art, by studying a Master‚Äôs degree in digital media, where I had the opportunity to learn about design thinking and project management.</p><br>
      
      <p>During the last year of my studies, <strong>I ventured in the startup world and co-founded Orbits</strong>, a real-time collaboration tool. While at Orbits, I had the opportunity to pitch our project to key people at Mozilla, Facebook, and Hootsuite.</p><br>

      <p>Besides art and design, music has been part of my life since I can remember. <strong>I danced ballet for 15 years</strong> which gave me the sensitivity to connect motion with music and storytelling.<br>
      Music composition is my emotional outlet every other day. I play the piano and experiment with electronic music. In the last few years, I've had a few piano recitals and the opportunity to play with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra School of Music during my piano studies there.</p><br>

      <p>My recent discovery about myself is that I love traveling. <strong>I spent close to 2 years as a digital nomad traveling and working remotely</strong>. I‚Äôve been privileged enough to make a home in places like Mexico, Canada, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and France.</p>
